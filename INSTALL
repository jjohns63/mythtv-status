Installing MythTV Status
========================

Depedencies
-----------
You will need to have the following Perl modules installed:

LWP::Simple
XML::LibXML
Date::Manip

If you have installed this package using Debian then they should already be
present.

MOTD
----
To update the message of the day you will probably want to modify
bin/mythtv-update-motd to work with the location of your /etc/motd
file (on Debian it is symlinked into /var/run), and then run that
script on a regular basis from cron.
