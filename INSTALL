Installing MythTV Status
========================

Dependencies
------------
You will need to have the following Perl modules installed:

  LWP::Simple
  XML::LibXML
  Date::Manip
  MIME::Entity
  MythTV - The MythTV Perl API <optional>

If you have installed this package using Debian then they should already be
present.

For Fedeora 7, the required package names are (they are all available via yum):
  perl-libwww-perl
  perl-XML-LibXML
  perl-DateManip
  perl-MIME-tools
  perl-MythTV

MOTD
----
To update the message of the day you will probably want to modify
bin/mythtv-update-motd to work with the location of your /etc/motd
file (on Debian it is symlinked into /var/run), and then run that
script on a regular basis from cron.
