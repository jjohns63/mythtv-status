Why this tool?
--------------
Well, as you can see above Grey's Anatomy is currently being recorded
at 1:30 PM.  My wife and I sat down to watch one of these episodes (yes
they're repeats, we've only just discovered Grey's Anatomy so repeats
are good) and one of them was very jumpy.  It was pretty obvious the
server was under load.  My wife was a little annoyed when I admitted
that I was probably compiling a new kernel at the time.

I wrote this script to notify me when I login about any work that MythTV
might be wanting to do in the next little while (or currently) so we
won't have any repeats of the Grey's Anatomy incident.
