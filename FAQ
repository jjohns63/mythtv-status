Some sometimes asked questions...

Q) Why not just run mythtv-status from your .profile (or similar)?
A) Simple reason, speed.  When I first wrote mythtv-status I was running it
out of my .profile, bit it slowed down logging in by about 2-3 seconds.
Which was just enough to be annoying.

That is why I decided to update the MOTD instead.  This way how long the
script takes to run doesn't matter, you never have to run it
interactively.

Q) What provides the perl API?
A) It comes from the MythTV svn repository:
  http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/browser/branches/release-0-20-fixes/mythtv/bindings/perl
It is also on trunk (obviously).

If you are using Christian Marillat's Debian packages then it is called
mythtv-perl (apt-get install mythtv-perl).  Christian's packages are
available at:
  http://www.debian-multimedia.org

Q) I want to see disk space individually for each of my storage groups, how
can I do this?
A) If you're using storage groups then you're currently running from SVN,
so you should be comfortable with what you need to do.  Namely, apply a
couple of patches to MythTV and recompile.  The patches are known to apply
against r15127.  If they don't, please let me (andrew@etc.gen.nz) know.

Grab the patches from:
  - http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/4278
  - http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/4280 (the latest patch)

Apply them, using something like the following from the root of your MythTV
build tree:

patch -p1 < 0001-Return-the-storage-group-data-using-a-sensible-XML-a.patch
patch -p1 < 0003-Allow-defining-different-versions-of-the-XML-without.2.patch

(The names might vary if I update the patches)
