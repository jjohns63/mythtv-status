Some sometimes asked questions...

Q) Why not just run mythtv-status from your .profile (or similar)?
A) Simple reason, speed.  When I first wrote mythtv-status I was running it
out of my .profile, bit it slowed down logging in by about 2-3 seconds.
Which was just enough to be annoying.

That is why I decided to update the MOTD instead.  This way how long the
script takes to run doesn't matter, you never have to run it
interactively.

Q) What provides the perl API?
A) It comes from the MythTV svn repository:
  http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/browser/branches/release-0-20-fixes/mythtv/bindings/perl
It is also on trunk (obviously).

If you are using Christian Marillat's Debian packages then it is called
mythtv-perl (apt-get install mythtv-perl).  Christian's packages are
available at:
