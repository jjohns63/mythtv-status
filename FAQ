Some sometimes asked questions...

Q) Why not just run mythtv-status from your .profile (or similar)?
A) Simple reason, speed.  When I first wrote mythtv-status I was running it
out of my .profile, bit it slowed down logging in by about 2-3 seconds.
Which was just enough to be annoying.

That is why I decided to update the MOTD instead.  This way how long the
script takes to run doesn't matter, you never have to run it
interactively.
